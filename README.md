# MicroBudgeting
A tiny watchOS app for daily micro-budgeting. Log each day as Cheap, Medium, or Expensive and track your spending vibe over time.

## Update
This project will move to iOS. Great learning experience on developing on watchOS, but felt that this app was better to be developed on iOS for more screen real estate!
