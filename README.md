# MicroBudgeting
A tiny watchOS app for daily micro-budgeting. Log each day as Cheap, Medium, or Expensive and track your spending vibe over time.

## Update
This project is on hold. Thinking that this app is better when developed on iOS rather than watchOS. May pick this up in the future, but onto the next!
